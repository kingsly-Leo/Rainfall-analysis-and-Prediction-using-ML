# Rainfall Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Rainfall Analysis and Prediction project. This repository provides a complete workflow for analyzing historical rainfall data and building predictive models using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Predicting rainfall accurately is essential for agriculture, water resource planning, and disaster management. This project applies robust machine learning algorithms to extract insights from historical rainfall data and generate reliable rainfall forecasts.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends
- Implementation of multiple ML models for rainfall prediction
- Model evaluation using standard performance metrics
- Visualizations to support analysis and decision-making

## Technology Stack

- **Python**
- **pandas, numpy** – Data handling
- **scikit-learn** – Machine learning
- **matplotlib, seaborn** – Visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kingsly-Leo/Rainfall-analysis-and-Prediction-using-ML.git
cd Rainfall-analysis-and-Prediction-using-ML
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare the Data

Add your rainfall dataset to the `data/` folder. Ensure the data format matches the expectations in the notebooks or scripts.

### 4. Run Analysis and Prediction

Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory or run the Python scripts inside `scripts/` to execute analysis and modeling.
